#Vulkan SDK Test 1

This is a basic project where I learn how to use the Vulkan SDK.

#Steps

1. Can my computer run with Vulkan?
  * No. :( Looks like I need to get a new GPU and ensure the drivers will work on Linux.

2. Install the SDK
  * Done

3. Write something that initialises Vulkan and outputs something to the screen
  * Started following the https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment tutorial. Not finished and no point continuing until I have a working GPU for this

4. Get a better keyboard. This one is rubbish and I am a lot of mistakes with it :(

5. Profit!!!!
