#Vulkan SDK Test 1

This is a basic project where I learn how to use the Vulkan SDK.

#Steps

1. Can my computer run with Vulkan?

2. Install the SDK

3. Write something that initialises Vulkan and outputs something to the screen

4. Get a better keyboard. This one is rubbish and I am a lot of mistakes with it :(

5. Profit!!!!
